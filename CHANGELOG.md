# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project is in the process of adopting [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added unit:MicroMOL-PER-KiloGM-YR

### Changed

- Increased the precision of conversion multipliers for unit:DEG, unit:REV and related units

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- Found and fixed some erroneous values for rdfs:isDefinedBy
- Rolled back the FactorUnit changes until the source of the error is found

## [3.1.8] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- Added quantityKind:CoolingPerformanceRatio & unit:KiloW-PER-TON_FG
- Added a new class and instances for crypto currency units
- Added an inference in the build that causes inheritance of rdfs:type down the skos:broader hierarchy.

### Changed

- Fixed spelling errors in descriptions for CurrencyUnit, fieldCode, normativeReference, BaseDimensionMagnitude. For both OWL and SHACL schemas. ([Vlad Korolev](https://github.com/vladistan))

### Deprecated

- Replaced CM_H2O with CentiM_H2O

### Fixed

- Added a type declaration (qudt:FactorUnit) for the anonymous nodes describing factor units.

## [3.1.7] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- Defined some missing factor units, such as unit:MicroGALILEO
- Added unit:PERMILLE, analogous to unit:PERCENT
- Added quantityKind:RateOfChange & unit:PERCENT-PER-SEC
- Added unit:TON_UK-PER-HR
- Added unit:RAYL_MKS to distinguish it from the CGS version, unit:RAYL

### Changed

- Build process
  - with `-DdeprecatedInVersion=[releaseVersion]`, a maven build now generates all vocab files from that `releaseVersion` into
    `target/deprecated-in-[releaseVersion]`, containing only the entities that are `qudt:deprecated` in that
    release
- Declared a few more units as being of type qudt:ContextualUnit, such as unit:SAMPLE-PER-SEC.
- Modified the build process to generate all component units. If a compound unit is a qudt:ContextualUnit, then so are the **newly generated** component units. So, for example, unit:SAMPLE is now generated as a ContextualUnit to support unit:SAMPLE-PER-SEC. This is needed to allow consistent validation of factor units, dimension vectors and other relations. Converseley, if an **existing** ContextualUnit is a component of a compound unit, then that compound unit is also declared as a ContextualUnit.
- Further modified the build process to define new dimension vectors if they are referred to by a unit, but do not yet exist.
- Another build update, to add rdfs:isDefinedBy triple for any units where it is missing
- Replaced quantityKind:Frequency to quantityKind:RateOfChange for unit:PERCENT-PER-YR & unit:PERCENT-PER-WK

### Deprecated

- Replaced OHM_CIRC-MIL-PER-FT with OHM-MIL_Circ-PER-FT
- Replaced unit:PER-MILLE-PSI with unit:PERMILLE-PER-PSI
- Replaced unit:MIL with unit:MIL_Angle and unit:MIL_Length to distinguish the two meanings
- Deprecated unit:HeartBeat in favor of unit:BEAT

### Fixed

- Fixed the distinction between unit:MI_US (U.S. Survey Mile) and unit:MI (International mile).
- Corrected errors in the definition of the variants of constant:MolarVolumeOfIdealGas...
- Fixed 17 unmatched HTML tags in description fields.
- Fixed some missing rdfs:isDefinedBy triples in the datatypes vocabulary.

## [3.1.6] - 2025-09-29

### Added

- `quantitykind:NumberOfElectricalPhases` for use with AC circuits

### Changed

- Build process
  - 'qudt:ucumCode' is now calculated based on factor units or base units, the same way `qudt:symbol` is. The 'canonical'
    form is used throughout no (`/`), just multiplication of factors with positive or negative exponents, in the order
    they appear in the unit's localname
- SHACL shapes: enforce at most one `qudt:ucumCode` per unit.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated dimension vector A0E0L0I0M0H0T0D0, which has no valid definition. A unit or quantity kind either has a dimension based on the 7 base SI dimensions, or it is dimensionless, with a "D1".

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in `qudt:ucumCode` of `unit:MegaN-PER-M2`
- Tweaked some multi-line validation error messages for environments that only display the first line (e.g. TopBraid)
- Fixed `qudt:ucumCode` of many units, such that they all follow the same pattern (see 'Changed' below), and such that
  no unit has more than one.
- Fixed descriptions of `quantitykind:Activity` and `quantitykind:ActivityConcentration` ([Henrike Fleischhack](https://github.com/henrikef)).

## [3.1.5] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- `unit:NCM` to support the Dutch hydrocarbons sector
- `unit:NCM_1ATM_0DEG_C_NL` which is quantified further by `unit:NCM`
- `unit:SCM_1ATM_0DEG_C` which is a contextual unit of `unit:SCM`
- `unit:SCM_1ATM_15DEG_C_ISO` which is a contextual unit of `unit:SCM`
- `unit:SCM_1ATM_15DEG_C_NL` which is a Dutch hydrocarbons sector quantification of `unit:SCM`
- `unit:MicroM-PER-SEC2`, originally requested by @nicholascar
- Explicitly declared all the xsd datatypes to be instances of rdfs:Datatype in the SHACL datatypes schema file
- Added links to the matching Wikidata entities that point to QUDT entities
- Added altSymbol mM to MillMOL-PER-L
- Added new relation qudt:hasReciprocalUnit to link units that are reciprocal, such as `unit:W-PER-K` and `unit:K-PER-W`.
- Added `qk:TimePerCount` and units `unit:SEC-PER-NUM`, with scaled versions
  - `unit:MIN-PER-NUM`
  - `unit:HR-PER-NUM`
  - `unit:DAY-PER-NUM`
  - `unit:WK-PER-NUM`
  - `unit:MO-PER-NUM`
  - `unit:YR-PER-NUM`
- Added `qk:PowerPerVolume` and equivalent `qk:PowerDensity`
- Added
  - `unit:KiloN-PER-CentiM2`
  - `unit:KiloN-PER-MillM2`
  - `unit:MegaN-PER-M2`
  - `unit:MegaN-PER-M3`
- Added a check enforcing a `rdf:type qudt:Unit` triple for each unit.
- Added
  - `unit:MIN-PER-KiloM`, `unit:MIN-PER-MI` and `qk:Pace`

### Changed

- Build process change by [Florian Kleedorfer](https://github.com/fkleedorfer)
  - Unit labels are now autogenerated for a number of languages, wherever possible
  - Title Case is now enforced in unit labels for many languages and warned about in other entity labels

### Deprecated

- Removed schema/extensions/FUNCTIONS_QUDT.spin.ttl that is no longer used in the calculation of applicable units
- Removed src/build/all-in-one/all-in-one-ontology.ttl that is no longer used in creating the all-in-one files
- Depecated quantitykind:DensityOfStates in favor of quantitykind:VibrationalDensityOfStates, to clarify its distinction from quantitykind:EnergyDensityOfStates

### Fixed

- Fixed datatype definitions missing rdfs:isDefinedBy triples
- Fixed the case of qudt:SIGNED and UNSIGNED to be qudt:Signed and qudt:Unsigned
- Corrected `quantitykind:BohrMagneton` to `constant:BohrMagneton`
- Corrected `quantitykind:MagneticFluxQuantum` to `constant:MagneticFluxQuantum`
- Fixed some typos
- Fixed source formatting with `mvn spotless:apply`, which was broken by a recent change.
- Fixed a variety of entities that were referred to but not defined (thanks to @ektrah).
- Updated src/main/rdf/schema/SCHEMA-FACADE_QUDT.ttl to remove obsolete imports
- Moved and renamed some files in src/build for future collection files
- Renamed folder `src/build/srcgen` to `src/build/sparql2shacl` to reflect the folder's purpose more precisely
- Fixed a typo in the `quantitykind:Length` description
- Cleaned up treatment of Imperial Gallons and exact matches
- Fixed typo in MilliL & MilliMOL-PER-L
- Moved `qudt-shacl-functions.ttl` from `src/main/rdf/validation` to
  `src/build/validation` because this file is only used during the build and are not to be distibuted with the release.
- Removed all import references to `COLLECTION_QUDT_QA_TESTS_ALL.ttl`, but left it in the src/main/rdf/validation folder for development users (especially those using environments like TopBraid that follow transitive import closures). Validating that file will validate the entire QUDT vocabulary & ontology graph set against the development tests, as well as the user tests.
- Moved the triples from `src/build/inference/factorUnits/predefined-factor-units-and-scalings.ttl` to the units file
- Fixed symbol of `unit:BFT`
- `unit:W-PER-M3` used to be `qk:ForcePerAreaTime` which is weird, it is assciated with new `qk:PowerPerVolume`,  `qk:PowerDensity`
- Moved some constraints that were in the SHACL-SCHEMA-SUPPLEMENT file over to the SCHEMA_QUDT_NoOWL.ttl file where they belong
- Fixed error in qfn:bound function

## [3.1.4] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- New Distribution Files
  - dist/QUDT-all-in-one-SHACL.ttl: the union of all vocab files and the shacl schema.
  - dist/QUDT-all-in-one-OWL.ttl: the union of all vocab files and the OWL schema.
  - Users can load just one of these files as a convenience, without needing to follow transitive owl:imports.
- New Units
  - `M2-PER-HR` to support the Netherlands water pumping sector
  - `unit:BAR_A` which is implied by `unit:MilliBar_A`
  - `unit:BasePair` which is implied by `unit:GigaBasePair`
  - `unit:FLOPS` which is implied by e.g `unit:TeraFLOPS`
  - `unit:Ci` (deprecated) which is implied by e.g. now-deprecated `unit:KiloCi`

### Changed

- Build process
  - Recoverable data errors in `src` are now automatically fixed with the `fix` profile, ie using `mvn -Pfix install`
    Autocorrection is only possible for units that are either derived or scaled. Derived units are those for which
    `qudt:hasFactorUnit` triples are generated during the build. Scaled units are those for which `qudt:scalingOf`
    triples are generated.
    The following properties will be auto-generated or corrected for such units:
    - `qudt:conversionMulitplier`
    - `qudt:conversionMulitplierSN`
    - `qudt:hasDimensionVector`
    - `qudt:symbol`
    - `qudt:hasQuantityKind`
    - `qudt:hasReferenceQuantityKind`
    - `qudt:systemDerivedQuantityKind`
    - `skos:broader`
    - `rdfs:seeAlso`
  - Improved consistency checks
    - Checks for dimension vectors based on factors / scalingOf
    - Checks for missing deprecation triples
    - Checks for mixing of factors and scalingOf
  - Inference calculations during the build process were sped up by an order of magnitude
  - Dimension vectors for scaled units and derived units can now be inferred
  - Set conversion multiplier 1.0 on each currency unit (in `unit:` namespace)
  - Set conversion multiplier for any unit that does not have one to 0.0 at the end of the build process
  - Every unit now has a conversion multiplier
  - Certain consistency problems can now be fixed in the source with the `fix-src` pipeline (`mvn rdfio:pipeline@fix-src`)
  - Replaced references to deprecated concepts with the replacement concepts
- Descriptions
  - Changed "Thermal heat capacity" to "total energy per unit mass, commonly known as specific enthalpy" for unit:BTU_TH-PER-LB
  - Changed "Thermal heat capacity" to "total energy per unit mass, commonly known as specific enthalpy" for unit:J-PER-KiloGM
  - Further specified sources for, and applications of, unit:SCM and derivatives, including linking to unit:NCM

### Deprecated

- `unit:MicroGAL-PER-M` (new unit: `unit:MicroGALILEO-PER-M`)
- `unit:MilliGAL` (new unit: `unit:MilliGALILEO`)
- `unit:MilliGAL-PER-MO` (new unit: `unit:MilliGALILEO-PER-MO`)
- `unit:Ci` (added for consistency, new unit: `unit:CI`)
- `unit:KiloCi` (new unit: `unit:KiloCI`)
- `unit:MicroCi` (new unit: `unit:MicroCI`)
- `unit:MilliCi` (new unit: `unit:MilliCI`)
- `unit:CAL_15_DEG_C` (new unit: `unit:CAL_15DEG_C`)
- `quantitykind:ConductivityVariance_NEON` (replacement: `quantitykind:ConductivityVariance`)
- `quantitykind:MolarFluxDensityVariance_NEON` (replacement: `quantitykind:MolarFluxDensityVariance`)
- `quantitykind:TemperatureVariance_NEON` (replacement: `quantitykind:TemperatureVariance`)
- Deprecated quantity kinds that represented the union of several other quantity kinds. Treatment of alternatives should be handled by applications.

### Fixed

- Added `qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:AmountOfSubstanceFraction` to `unit:PPM`, `unit:PPB`, `unit:PPT`, `unit:PPQ`, `unit:PPTM`, `unit:PPTH`, and removed it from `unit:UNITLESS`
- Fix wrong `qudt:isReplacedBy CCY_CCY_AED` statement in old currency units file `src/main/rdf/vocab/currency/VOCAB_QUDT-UNITS-CURRENCY.ttl`.
- Corrected dimension vectors of units
  - `unit:VAR`
  - `unit:VAR-PER-K`
  - `unit:KiloVAR-PER-K`
  - `unit:MicroVAR-PER-K`
  - `unit:MilliVAR-PER-K`
  - `unit:W-PER-M2-MicroM` (also required using a different QuantityKind)
- Add factor units to `unit:VAR`
- Add `unit:KiloCubicFT qudt:scalingOf unit:FT3
- Corrected mixing factors and scalingOf in `unit:DEG_C`
- Prefixes and scalingOf are now always consistent: all units with scaling prefix (e.g. `KiloM`) now have `qudt:scalingOf`
- Make `rdfs:label`s treatment of Titlecase more consistent for units
- Corrected multiplier of `unit:MIL`
- Added `unit:GM qudt:scalingOf unit:KiloGM`, such that the standard algorithm for determining conversion multipliers (following factor units and scalings recursively) applies correctly.
  E.g, for `unit:DecaGM`: `conversionMultiplier = prefix:Deca.prefixMultiplier * unit:GM.conversionMultiplier = 10.0 * 0.001 = 0.01`
- Corrected 136 unit symbols
- Prevent title case violations in `rdfs:label` values of `qudt:Unit, qudt:QuantityKind, qudt:Prefix, qudt:PhysicalConstant, qudt:ConstantValue`.

## [3.1.3] - 2025-06-26

### Added

- Added an updated intro slide deck in the doc folder
- New Units
  - `unit:CCY_CHF-PER-HA`
- Auto-generate labels for units wherever possible

### Changed

- All instances of `xsd:decimal` are limited to a maximum precision of 34 significant digits
- Build process by [Florian Kleedorfer](https://github.com/fkleedorfer)
  - New maven goal `rdfio:pipeline` that allows for fine-grained rdf file manipulation
  - New `mainPipeline` execution for the bulk of rdf munging
  - New `src/main/rdf/validation/qudt-shacl-functions.ttl` to make some intricate functionality
    available to SPARQL and SHACL
  - New `unitTestPipeline` for unit testing the SHACL functions
  - Derived units: recalculation of `qudt:conversionMultiplier` and `qudt:conversionMultiplierSN`
    - During the build, all derived units' conversion multipliers are checked based on their `qudt:factorUnits`
      and replaced with the calculated result if necessary

### Deprecated

- Deprecated unit:CHF-PER-KiloGM in favor of unit:CCY_CHF-PER-KiloGM
- Deprecated roughly 36 Quantity Kinds in favor of more consistently-named and natural-language-friendly URIs. Specifically, URIs containing
  underscores are renamed except when the underscore identifies a component (e.g. x, y, z, imaginary, real).
  Quantity Kinds raised to a power are renamed (e.g. Time_Squared becomes SquareTime)
- Cleaned up some confusion regarding unit:PERM_US and unit:PERM_Metric, resulting in the deprecation of some related units. The summary
  is that the magnitude of a PERM does not change with temperature, but measurements made on materials will have different measured values
  at different temperatures.

### Fixed

- Fixed erroneous prefix definition for cross-references to SI Quantity (equivalent to qudt:QuantityKind)
- Corrected symbol for `unit:IN_H2O` from `inH₂0` to `inH₂O` [Reto Schneebeli](https://github.com/reto-siemens)
- Removed wrong `qudt:conversionMultipliers` from `src` (they are now generated correctly in `target`, see 'Changed'). Affected units:
  - `unit:MicroKAT-PER-L, unit:MilliKAT-PER-L, unit:NanoKAT-PER-L, unit:PicoKAT-PER-L, unit:MilliOSM-PER-KiloGM`

## [3.1.2] - 2025-05-30

### Added

- New Units
  - unit:KiloPOISE
  - unit:PIXEL_Count
  - unit:PIXEL_Area
  - unit:CCY_BGN-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_CHF-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_CZK-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_DKK-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_GBP-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_HUF-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_NOK-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_PLN-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_RON-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:CCY_SEK-PER-KiloW-HR
  - unit:DEG_C-HR
  - unit:DEG_C-DAY
  - unit:DEG_F-DAY
  - unit:MilliBAR_A by [Toby Broom](https://github.com/Toby-Broom/)

### Changed

- Increased the severity of some validation constraints
- Added description to unit:DEG_F-DAY
- Changed qualifiers on unit:PIXEL to be uppercase, for consistency with current use
- Added qudt:Unit to hasUnit, hasDefinedUnit & hasAllowedUnit
- Added `qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:BatteryCapacity` to `unit:A-HR`, `unit:A-SEC`, `unit:KiloA-HR` and `unit:MilliA-HR`
- conversion multipliers:
  a SHACL check was added to compare the conversion multipliers of derived units withthe conversion multiplier obtained from the factor units, failing the build if there is a discrepancy. This is a first step toward more stability with regard to conversion multipliers.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated unit:2PiRAD as a unit, replaced with unit:REV.
- Deprecated unit:IN-PER-2PiRAD, replaced with unit:IN-PER-REV.
- Deprecated the ambiguous unit:PIXEL, with seeAlso notes to unit:PIXEL_Area and unit:PIXEL_Count.

### Fixed

- Corrected symbol of `unit:BU_US` and `unit:GAL_US`, which both were `in³`.
- Fixed some units with rdfs:isDefinedBy lacking version, and added a constraint to check for this.
- Corrected conversion multipliers for unit:DEG_F-DAY

## [3.1.1] - 2025-04-23

### Added

- New Units
  - Counting units for some powers of ten; specifically TEN, HUNDRED, THOUSAND, MILLION, BILLION_Short and BILLION_Long.
    This allows some dimensionless counts to have more intuitive URIs, such as unit:PERCENT-PER-TEN-THOUSAND instead of
    unit:PERCENT-PER-DecaKiloCOUNT.
  - unit:COUNT was added as an exact match with unit:NUM. Both units have a quantity kind of Count (and others).
- New Coordinate Systems SHACL schema.
  - OWL schema for coordinate systems is work-in-progress.

### Changed

- Updated and fixed constraint for use of hasFactorUnit in OWL schema
- Added `qk:Emissivity` to `unit:PERCENT`
- Fixed mistakes on MicroW-PER-CentiM2-MicroM-SR, unit:W-PER-M2-MicroM, unit:W-PER-M2-MicroM-SR, J-PER-M2-SEC0pt5-K variously replacing qudit:unit to qudt:Unit, adding SI as applicable system, and removing @en-us tag from a plainTextDescription, changing conversionMultiplierSM to conversionMultiplierSN, and adding decimal point to xsd:double values, and avoiding using explicit datatypes on conversion factors.
- Upgraded the closed world validation constraint from sh:Info to sh:Violation. Errors will now cause the build to fail.
- Untangled unit:AWG and unit:CCY_AWG that had become combined in migration of currency into units graph
- Refactored and cleaned up applicable units for ElectricPower subtree, deprecating ComplexPower
- Updated the SHACL schema for datatypes to specify qudt:Concept as the ultimate parent. OWL schema for datatypes
  is work-in-progress.
- Refactored coordinate systems into a new SHACL schema for coordinate systems. OWL schema for coordinate systems
  is work-in-progress.
- Tweaked the definition and applicableUnits for quantitykind:StateOfCharge

### Deprecated

- Removed 8 invalid dimension vectors (without deprecation since they were invalid)
- Quantity kind ComplexPower, replaced by ElectricPower. ActivePower, ReactivePower and ApparentPower are still available, having skos:broader of ElectricPower.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-03-20

### Added

- New Units
  - `unit:MilliGM-PER-DeciM2` by [Matt Goldberg](https://github.com/mgberg)
- Factor Units by [Florian Kleedorfer](https://github.com/fkleedorfer):
  - During the build process, multiple SPARQL queries determine the 'factor units' that derived
    units are made up of. The factor units are associated with their derived units via `qudt:hasFactorUnit' triples.
  - Units that are 'scaled', ie. derived from another, non-derived unit with conversionMultiplier 1.0 by multiplication,
    are connected with that unit via `qudt:scalingOf`.
  - Wherever the connection cannot be determined from the units' localnames, the triples are explicitly listed
    in the file `src/build/inference/factorUnits/predefined-factors-and-scalings.ttl`, which are added to
    the units file (`target/dist/vocab/unit/VOCAB_QUDT-UNITS-ALL.ttl`) during the build
- a new BUILDING.md file
- Added the ContextualUnit class, to identify units that are common, but are really specializations of generic units.
- New Quantity Kinds: ServiceFactor, DutyCycle, WetBulbTemperature, DryBulbTemperature, supporting building management
- New Quantity Kind: State of Charge for batteries https://github.com/lazlop

### Changed

- Removed invalid qudt:iec61360Code values (most in the 'UAD' range) from about 40 units, most notably unit:M that was submitted as a bug.
- Cleaned out some remaining shape and restriction references to deprecated properties.

### Deprecated

- Replaced unit:PPTR_VOL with unit:PPT_VOL
- Deprecated 13 remaining units with non-uppercase URIs, replacing as appropriate.
- Replaced the volt ampere family of units having URIs with V-A, to have VA instead.
- Further, replaced ..V-A_Reactive with ...VAR.
- Deprecated all currency units in the currency graph, with redirection from cur:<currency> to unit:CCY_<currency> in the unit graph.
  The "class preamble" is there to avoid collisions of URI with non-currency units (Notably unit:CUP and unit:CCY_CUP).

## [3.0.0] - 2025-02-13

### Changed

- Replaced `2.1` with `$$QUDT_VERSION$$` in all graph URI references. This will result in URIs containing
  full semantic versions, such as 3.0.0, moving forward. Note that this is a breaking change, hence
  the transition to QUDT version 3. Versionless graph URIs are still dereferenceable on the web.

### Deprecated

- Removed all previously deprecated entities, to begin a new cycle of deprecation when needed.

### Fixed

- Corrected unit symbols containing some kind of conversion artifact, e.g. '<C2>'
- Fix dimension vector of unit:MicroMOL-PER-M2-SEC2
- Added the newly referred-to dimension vector to the dv vocabulary
- Corrected 456 unit symbols of derived unist by generating them based on their factors. Note: correcting
  derived unit symbols without correcting their factor units (e.g. `km/hr` -> `km/h` without `hr`->`h`)
  will not solve the problem in the long term. We are not yet automatically detecting and correcting
  incorrect derived unit symbols but it might happen in the future. If we started doing that, the factors
  would take precedence.
- Corrected the language tag `@en-us` to `@en-US`
- Corrected a small number of conversion multipliers

## [2.1.47] - 2025-01-28

### Added

### Changed

- Migrated constructs for datatypes to:
  - new SHACL Schema for Datatypes
    - Updated OWL Schema is work-in-progress
  - existing VOCAB for Datatypes
- Changes to the SHACL QUDT schema:
  - Added a `value` constraint to the property shape `qudt:Quantifiable-value` to allow a value

  - `qudt:informativeReference` can now refer to instances of `qudt:Citation` as well as `xsd:anyURI`
- Removed the vaem:revision triples that were causing retention of v2.1 strings in the URIs
- `qudt:informativeReference` triples added/replaced by a link to IEC CDD generated based on `qudt:iec61360Code` triples by [Vladimir Alexiev](https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev)

  - `unit:FLIGHT` (replaces `unit:Flight`)
- Other Additions
  - Add "mph" as `qudt:altSymbol` of `unit:M-PER-HR` from [Toby Broom](https://github.com/Toby-Broom/)
  - Add "kph" as `qudt:altSymbol` of `unit:KiloM-PER-HR` from [Toby Broom](https://github.com/Toby-Broom/)
  - SHACL validation of SHACL shapes by [Dimitris Kontokostas](https://github.com/jimkont)

### Changed

- Enforce at most a single qudt:symbol for all instances.
- Delete spurious qudt:symbol values in a number of quantity kinds
- Correct the conversion offset for MilliDEG_C
- Rename `qk:VaporPermeability` to `qk:VaporPermeance` and change all unit associations accordingly.
- Unify `PER-X` symbols to the 15:1 majority pattern, `"/x"` where `"1/x"` is used
- Unify `NUM-PER-X` symbols to always represent `NUM` as `#` (as has already been used in `unit:NUM`)
- Remove `qk:NumberDensity` from `unit:PER-M3`
- Make `qk:RotationalFrequency` exactMatch of `qk:RotationalVelocity`, remove broader qk
- Make `qk:AngularFrequency` exactMatch of `qk:AngularVelocity`, remove broader qk

### Deprecated

- `unit:Ci` (replaced by: `unit:CI`)
- `unit:Flight` (replaced by: `unit:FLIGHT`)
- `qk:CurrentOfTheAmountOfSubtance` (replaced by `qk:CurrentOfTheAmountOfSubstance`)
- `unit:CFU` (replaced by: `unit:NUM`) - The CFU (colony forming unit) is a context-dependent unit that should
  be part of an ontology with narrower scope than QUDT.

## [2.1.45] - 2024-11-15

### Changed

- Changed the name of the `collections` folder to `validation`.
- Remove all version suffixes from all source files, i.e., `-v2.1.ttl` becomes `.ttl`

### Fixed

- Added `skos:broader` relations to a number of quantity kinds that had none. Note that it is ok for a
  quantity kind to have no broader quantity kind, but these were missing.
- Changed the erroneously used 'qudt:hasDimensionVector' property in `vocab/types/VOCAB_QUDT_DATATYPES-v2.1.ttl`
  file with with a new property qudt:dimensions that denotes the dimensions of a matrix.
- Introduced a maven based build process to automate the manual tasks required for merging PRs and making releases.
  This change does not affect the content of the ontologies.
- Replaced (hopefully) all occurrences of `hr` as a symbol for `unit:HR` with `h`.
- Add `unit:NUM-PER-MilliL`

## 2.1.44 - 2024-10-27

### Fixed

- A new quantity kind, ElevationRelativeToNAP, has been added to support the Amsterdam Ordnance
  System (thanks @RiX012).
- **Big housecleaning month!** Many of the unused graphs that have been lying around the repository
  have been moved to a behind-the-scenes repository, including references to some of the unused
  concepts in our active graphs. If you have been quietly using them yourself in your own work and
  would like us to restore any of them, please let us know in a new Issue. Otherwise, we now have a
  more streamlined repository while retaining all the functionality you have been depending on.
- The qudt:currencyNumber relation now points to a string with the currency code, rather than an
  integer. This makes sense because it is not used for computation - it is a code in the true
  sense. (Thanks for this fix, @fkleedorfer)
- A number of units now point to quantitykind:MassConcentration in addition to MassDensity and Density.
  (thanks @J-meirlaen). (MassDensity and Density are already declared as qudt:exactMatch.
  MassConcentration will be included in these declarations in the future.)

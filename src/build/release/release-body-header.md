# Highlights

This release provides several significant improvements in both consistency and ease of use. 

Note in the "Added" section that we now provide two versions of a single file that contains everything a user needs in one place - the schemas and the vocabularies. Depending on whether you are using OWL or SHACL, your application can now simply load or import one of these files, available in the release Zip file. They are also resolvable on the web as http://qudt.org/qudt-all (for OWL) and http://qudt.org/shacl/qudt-all (for SHACL). There are also resolvable versioned URIs starting with version 3.1.4, with URIs http://qudt.org/3.1.4/qudt-all (for OWL) and http://qudt.org/3.1.4/shacl/qudt-all (for SHACL).

Note also in the "Changed" section that our automated build process is much improved to ensure consistency among vocabulary entries. Please read the description where you will learn that many of the properties of units are now auto-corrected for new additions. We will be updating our Wiki documentation to reflect these improvements soon.

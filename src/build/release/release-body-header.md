# Highlights

This release introduces more improvements to the Maven build process to automate creation of more of the triples needed for new units and dimension vectors. We have also expanded our [documentation on contributing to QUDT](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/wiki), including Tutorials and Troubleshooting assistance. Stay tuned for more documentation as time allows.

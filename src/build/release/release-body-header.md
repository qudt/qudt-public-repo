# Highlights

QUDT is continuing its strategy of improving consistency of the vocabularies. With this Release, the UCUM codes for units are now autogenerated, using positive and negative exponents. Because of this, each unit now has only one UCUM code, but typos and errors in those codes have been eliminated.

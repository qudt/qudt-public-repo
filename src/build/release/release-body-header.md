## Announcement

We’re excited to announce that QUDT.org has signed a Letter of Intent with the [POSC Caesar Association (PCA)](https://www.posccaesar.org/). This collaboration marks an exciting new chapter for QUDT — ensuring its future growth, openness, and continued service to our global community of users.

PCA brings deep expertise in industrial data ontologies, open standards, and trusted stewardship.
Together, we will continue to build on the strong foundation of QUDT while preserving its open-
source model and commitment to community involvement.

Looking forward to working closely with Lars Berthinussen and the PCA team on this shared vision.

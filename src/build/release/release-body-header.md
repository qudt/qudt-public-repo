With this Release, we continue to refine our automated release mechanism.
Please check our [Good Git Practices](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/wiki/GoodGitPractices) page for some changes on how to submit contributions, including some new workflows available to make things easier for you.
Please read our updated README.md file, especially the [Installation instructions](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo#installation-instructions), for many of the details.

We hope this does not create too much of an incovenience. We invite you to submit GitHub Issues with any problems you encounter.

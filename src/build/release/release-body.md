# Breaking Changes
With this Release, we have migrated to an automated release mechanism. 
This includes reorganizing our directory structure.
Please read our updated README.md file (scroll to the bottom) for many of the details.

We hope this does not create too much of an incovenience. We invite you to submit GitHub Issues with any problems you encounter.

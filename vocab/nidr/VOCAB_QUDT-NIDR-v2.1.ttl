1. This Guide prefers the name “amount-of-substance concentration of B” for this quantity because it is unambiguous. However, in practice, it is often shortened to amount concentration of B, or even simply to concentration of B. Unfortunately, this last form can cause confusion because there are several different “concentrations,” for example, mass concentration of B, ρB = mB/V; and molecular concentration of B, CB = NB/V, where NB is the number of molecules of B.

2. The term normality and the symbol N should no longer be used because they are obsolete.
